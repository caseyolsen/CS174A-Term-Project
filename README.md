### Overview

Our **vending machine game** allows the player to use keystrokes to vend items from the machine by following randomly generated commands. When an item gets stuck, the player is prompted to shake the vending machine in a specified direction. Items will fall from their slots if the correct item is vended, or the player correctly follows the prompt to shake the machine. There are sounds that are played to correspond to the actions (pressing buttons, vending, etc).

### Advanced Features

**Transparency** - The glass of the vending machines allows the player to view the items behind the glass in order to vend the appropriate items.

**Shadows** - A shadow shader is used to project the shadows of the vending machine onto the items in the room (the chair and the plant), more visibly seen when the vending machine shakes left, right, forward, backwards.

**OBJ model** - 

### Individual Roles

**Casey Olsen**
-I constructed the vending machine itself using a number of box and square objects

-I added the gates and items into the machine and made the vending motion when the correct buttons were pressed

-I added in the probability of an item getting stuck and changed the motion of the box when this happens

-I made the boxes get unstuck when the user shakes the machine in the correct direction and then continue their previous motion

**Hannah Park** 

-I placed all items/snacks in the vending machine in the appropriate spots, and used texture mapping to decorate them and make them resemble actual snacks.

-Also, I used texture mapping to apply labels on all slots in the machine (A1, A2, etc.). 

-I implemented transparency (advanced feature) of the glass of the vending macine.

-I used OBJ models (advanced feature) to create the chair and the plant, on either sides of the vending machines.

-I used shadow mapping (advanced feature) to project the shadow of the vending machine onto the chair and the plant (more visible when shaking the vending machine). By drawing the image of the scene from the light's vantage point, I created the appropriate image for shadow mapping.

-I decorated the room (walls, texture mapping on floor).

-I added sounds to the game and implementation for playing sounds, for each action of the player and machine (pressing buttons, shaking the machine, vending, continuous vending when items get stuck, items dropping).

**Kenna Wang**

-I created the room, placing walls, floor, ceiling, light fixture in the scene.

-I created machine shaking feature, animating machine rotation triggered by user input.

-I added buttons on the vending machine, animated them when the user pressed those buttons on the keyboard, used texture mapping on the buttons

-I turned vending machine into a game, creating score, timer, game prompts, and penalties.

-Modified CSS so that the program has scoreboard side by side with the scene. I also changed the appearance of the control panel and its contents.
