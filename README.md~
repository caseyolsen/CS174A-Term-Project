### Overview

Our **vending machine game** allows the player to use keystrokes to vend items from the machine by following randomly generated commands. When an item gets stuck, the player is prompted to shake the vending machine in a specified direction. Items will fall from their slots if the correct item is vended, or the player correctly follows the prompt to shake the machine. There are sounds that are played to correspond to the actions (pressing buttons, vending, etc).

### Advanced Features

**Transparency** - The glass of the vending machines allows the player to view the items behind the glass in order to vend the appropriate items.

**Shadows** - A shadow shader is used to project the shadows of the vending machine onto the items in the room (the chair and the plant), more visibly seen when the vending machine shakes left, right, forward, backwards.

### Individual Roles

**Casey Olsen** - 

**Hannah Park** - 
-I placed all items/snacks in the vending machine in the appropriate spots, and used texture mapping to decorate them and make them resemble actual snacks.
-Also, I used texture mapping to apply labels on all slots in the machine (A1, A2, etc.). 
-I implemented transparency (advanced feature) of the glass of the vending macine
-I used OBJ models (advanced feature) to create the chair and the plant, on either sides of the vending machines.
-I used shadow mapping (advanced feature) to project the shadow of the vending machine onto the chair and the plant (more visible when shaking the vending machine). By drawing the image of the scene from the light's vantage point, I created the appropriate image for shadow mapping.
-I decorated the room (walls, texture mapping on floor)
-I added sounds to the game for each action of the player and machine (pressing buttons, shaking the machine, vending, continuous vending when items get stuck, items dropping)
